# Card Magnifier

Zoom, Enlarge and bring closer to center the highlighted card during card pick and card bar preview for better readability! A handy client-side tool made by Pudassassin.

## **Presets**

#### \[Vanilla+]
- default at first installation
- zoom the card to fixed, more readable size while slightly pull the card toward the center of the screen

#### \[Fancy Zoom]*
- zoom it BEEG, and always pull the card toward center with transition time*
- \*may cause motion sickness in rare case, fair warning!

#### \[Insta-Zoom!]
- immediately enlarge the card and put it right in the center, no flipping!

#### \[Reduce Card Motions]
- remove transition time, card flipping when first revealed, card bobbing when (re)highlighted and reduce discarded cards motion
- clicking this keep other settings intact

## Note from the modder
Hopefully this mod will resolve a lot of issues about card offers that go off-screen or too small to read. Automatically adapt to screen resolutions and MapEmbiggener scaling

## Patch Notes
#### Public Beta 2-1 \[v0.2.1]
- "Disable Card Bobbing" is now functional
- AMENDED the "Growing Giant Card" issue down to just random bobbing, it is now a small known issue

#### Public Beta 2-0 \[v0.2.0]
- Clean up mod dependencies so it only depends on UnboundLib (mod configs) and of course BepInEx so allowing its use in a more Vanilla-like modpack
- Fixed issue with this mod and MapsExtended for overlapping card-bar card preview scaling
- Now card-bar card preview scales properly with camera zoom during the round

#### Public Beta 1-0 \[v0.1.0]
- It all begins. Core functionality with in-game options and demo
