# Card Magnifier [0.1.0] 
Public Release 0-1-0, build #27

Zoom, Enlarge and bring closer to center the highlighted card during card pick and card bar preview for better readability! A handy client-side tool made by Pudassassin.

## **Presets**

#### \[Vanilla+]
- default at first installation
- zoom the card to fixed, more readable size while slightly pull the card toward the center of the screen

#### \[Fancy Zoom]*
- zoom it BEEG, and always pull the card toward center with transition time*
- \*may cause motion sickness in rare case, fair warning!

#### \[Insta-Zoom!]
- immediately enlarge the card and put it right in the center, no flipping!

#### \[Reduce Card Motions]
- remove transition time, card flipping when first revealed, card bobbing when (re)highlighted and reduce discarded cards motion
- clicking this keep other settings intact

## Note from the modder
Hopefully this mod will resolve a lot of issues about card offers that go off-screen or too small to read. Automatically adapt to screen resolutions and MapEmbiggener scaling

## Patch Notes
#### Public Beta 1-0 \[v0.1.0]
- It all begins. Core functionality with in-game options and demo
